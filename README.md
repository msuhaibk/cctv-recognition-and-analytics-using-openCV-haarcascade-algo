# Store Monitoring and Customer Proclivity System

## Overview
This project is a **Customer Recognition and Monitoring System** for store surveillance, leveraging the **Haar Cascade algorithm**. It captures and recognizes customers, providing insights into their interests and purchase patterns based on their past billing history through a dedicated sales panel.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **SQLite3**

## Features
- **Real-time customer detection and recognition** using **Haar Cascade**.
- **Customer interest analysis** based on past billing history.
- **Sales panel** for data visualization and decision-making.
- **Insight Collection:** During checkout at the counter, customer details are recorded, including names and past billing history, which are linked to facial recognition data for personalized insights.

## Important Note
This project was originally developed **8 years ago**. A **newly built version** with improved features and a modern tech stack will be released soon. Stay tuned for updates!
